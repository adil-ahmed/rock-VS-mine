# rock-VS-mine
This project explored the use of Logistic Regression, a machine learning technique, to classify objects detected by sonar as either rocks or mines. We utilized a dataset containing sonar readings of various objects. To train the model effectively, 90% of the data was dedicated to the training phase. This allows the model to learn the patterns that distinguish rocks from mines based on the sonar data. The remaining 10% of the data served as a test set, enabling us to evaluate the model's accuracy.

The Logistic Regression model achieved a remarkable performance, exceeding 80% accuracy in correctly classifying rocks and mines. This is a simple practice project to understand the usage of machine learning algorithms.
